                <h2>FURIA</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by American football and the concept of 'Symbiosis'. With these in mind, FURIA was born.
                    What
                    does it suggest? ‘Life is furiouss, sexual, magic, brutal, it pushes us to our noblest heights and
                    our
                    lowest depths. From fury comes creation, inspiration, originality and passion. But also, violence,
                    pain,
                    pure destruction without fear of reprisals. FURIA is a brand that creates collections with
                    dyscruptive
                    concepts. A synonym for strength and design. FURIA chases us, and the fierce dance to create.

                <h2>CONTAINER</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by different existing 'containers', materialized in cowhide and cotton wool. The
                    inspiration behind this particular collection was 'entanglement', not in the literal sense of the
                    word, but of the deeper meaning behind it.
                    Entrañamiento means to include, contain or imply, entail, or enter the deepest parts of the soul,
                    intimately join two or more people. It is also joining, indulging wholeheartedly with someone or
                    something.

                <h2>DIMENSION</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Dionisio Gonzalez’s work, who combines architecture, design, art and structures.He
                    reinvents situations and suburban landscapes with new digital technologies. Almost all the
                    architecture on which he worked, was demolished. The concept I used to design was ‘create abstract
                    morphologies of the Dionisio’s buildings, and design new ones with the help of heat to shape it and
                    small perforations with laser cutting.

                <h2>JEWELRY</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the Rawson neighborhood located in Agronomy, a province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, with
                    its gray, static and geometric structures and buildings. In its desolate and quiet neighborhood but
                    in constant movement. What is immobility? Is it static? I descended to physical and moral
                    immobility, and the brain was brought to me. It is forbidden to learn to work and for the first
                    time, I feel that every movement tends to immobility.

                <h2>FANGIO</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Juan Manuel Fangio, who was an Argentinian speed motorist. The concept behind these
                    garments was swiftness. ‘I think that living fast is not living, it is surviving. Our culture
                    instills in us, the fear of wasting time, but the paradox is that acceleration makes us waste life’.
                    Today everyone suffers from the disease of time, the obsessive belief that time is moving away and
                    you must pedal faster and faster.

                <h2>MATRIX</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by The Matrix. I know you’re out there. I can feel you. I know you’re scared. You are
                    afraid of change. I do not know about the future. I came here to tell you how it’s going to start. I
                    KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE. I CAN FEEL YOU. I’m going to hang up this phone and I’m going to show you
                    what you do not want them to see. I am going to show you a world without rules or control, borders
                    or limits. A world where anything is possible.

            <div class="category">
                <h2>MUSEUM</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the clothing that was used in the 19th century in Rio de la Plata. They were garments
                    that sought to fulfill the needs of an everyday life, and several layers was used to protect oneself
                    from the cold, accoutrements with construction details and accessories in silver, to provide
                    resistance. The concept of the design is 'The evolution of the production processes, from the
                    accessory to the garment and the use of garment accessories, that alter the volume, generating new
                    silhouettes'.

                    Inspired by Juan Manuel Fangio, who was an Argentinian speed motorist. The concept behind these
                    garments was swiftness. ‘I think that living fast is not living, it is surviving. Our culture
                    instills in us, the fear of wasting time, but the paradox is that acceleration makes us waste
                    life’.
                    Today everyone suffers from the disease of time, the obsessive belief that time is moving away
                    and
                    you must pedal faster and faster.

                    Inspired by The Matrix. I know you’re out there. I can feel you. I know you’re scared. You are
                    afraid of change. I do not know about the future. I came here to tell you how it’s going to
                    start. I
                    KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE. I CAN FEEL YOU. I’m going to hang up this phone and I’m going to show you
                    what you do not want them to see. I am going to show you a world without rules or control,
                    borders
                    or limits. A world where anything is possible.

                    Inspired by the clothing that was used in the 19th century in Rio de la Plata. They were
                    garments
                    that sought to fulfill the needs of an everyday life, and several layers was used to protect
                    oneself
                    from the cold, accoutrements with construction details and accessories in silver, to provide
                    resistance. The concept of the design is 'The evolution of the production processes, from the
                    accessory to the garment and the use of garment accessories, that alter the volume, generating
                    new
                    silhouettes'.
